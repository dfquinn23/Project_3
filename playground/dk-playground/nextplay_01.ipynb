Yahoo Finance • 30 minutes ago TSLA +20.95% What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week? IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off “Magnificent Seven” earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM’s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, “The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated … It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.” While IBM’s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being “kind of clumped into” the Magnificent Seven group. “Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.” He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla’s earnings adds to the “good momentum” that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have “some indication” of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, “One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Yahoo Finance Video • 2 hours ago AAPL -0.19% TSLA +20.95% MSFT -0.10% Tesla is most underpriced AI play in the market: Dan Ives Tesla (TSLA) posted mixed third quarter results, with adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share surpassing the estimated $0.60, while revenue of $25.18 billion fell short of the $25.43 billion expected. Despite this, the automaker provided an optimistic forecast, projecting 20-30% growth for 2025. Wedbush Securities Managing Director & Senior Equity Analyst Dan Ives tells Morning Brief that margins were crucial this quarter. \"That's been a huge part of the overhang on this story. They beat by 200 bps (basis points). Price cuts in the rearview mirror. And when you combine that with that growth forecast, I think whisper numbers called ten, eleven percent. They gave twenty and thirty percent. It's an Aaron Judge-like quarter,\" Ives states. Ives predicts Tesla will launch an affordable EV priced under $30,000, boosting company revenues — a factor he believes is reflected in the growth forecast. While acknowledging a \"painful year\" for EV demand, he anticipates a \"renaissance of growth\" in 2025, driven by advances in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Regarding the upcoming US election's impact on the EV market, Ives tells Yahoo Finance: \"I do believe if Trump gets elected second term, it's bearish for EVs... but I do believe that it's bullish for Tesla.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief&nbsp;here. This post was written by Angel Smith Yahoo Finance Video • 4 hours ago TSLA +20.95% Elon Musk's 'distractions' might end up as a big win for him — and his companies: Morning Brief Tesla CEO (among other things) Elon Musk has been loudly campaigning for Trump and giving money away to help register voters. Getting deeper into politics hasn't seemed to hurt the car company, however, which just posted a surprise beat on profit in its Q3 results. Yahoo Finance • 7 hours ago TSLA +20.95% Tesla earnings: Are Full-Self Driving functions spurring demand? Tesla (TSLA) stock is climbing higher in extended-hours trading after reporting mixed third quarter earnings, missing revenue estimates ($25.18 billion vs. $25.43 billion expected) and posting adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share ($0.60 was expected). The EV maker stated it is on track for \"slight growth\" in EV deliveries for 2024, while projecting production on affordable EVs to begin in 2025. \"This just confirms what they've been saying, which is we're going to get affordable cars in the first half of next year,\" RBC Capital Markets Global Autos Analyst Tom Narayan tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton, adding: \"We all thought we were going to see something at the robotaxi event about this, but I think folks are just comforted to know that it is coming. Everything is on track on the more affordable cars.\" Narayan discusses Tesla's earnings print and what it is forecasting about the electric automaker's margins: \"They did do some discounting and they're going to try to get that growth number for the full year. So Q4 you're going to see some price-cutting. But if they can still do a 17% margin, X credits, that's a pretty strong signal that... they can continue to hold on to margins.\" Tesla reported 462,890 EV deliveries, just below Wall Street consensus estimates 463,897. Narayan believes Tesla's Full Self-Driving upgrades and pivots to autonomous driving could be boosting its demand. \"The services number was pretty high. So I do wonder if the services attach rate, especially FSD, might be making making an impact here. Folks could be thinking I'm going to buy this car because of FSD,\" Narayan says. \"That may be catalyzing demand. And kind of even though the models are maybe a little long in the tooth... FSD is something, something special here that might be what's happening.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime&nbsp;here.
